# Image-Dehazing-using-GAN-Derivatives
One fairly typical phenomena that impairs or
lessens visibility is haze. It creates a number of issues for
applications like security surveillance, autonomous cars,
satellite imagery where high resolution captures are
necessary. Therefore, clearing up haze from the imagery
of scenes is an urgent need for good vision. Different
kinds of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are
being used in addition to traditional dehazing processes
recently to reduce noise and enhance dehazing
performance. However, it's unclear how well these
algorithms would work with blurry photos taken "in the
wild" and how we might assess the state of the art. To
close this gap, a thorough comparison of two
cutting-edge modelsâ€” GAN and Wasserstein GAN, that
dehaze a single image is presented. Testing was done
using a benchmark dataset that included both synthetic
and real-world blurry photos. The resulting outcomes
are assessed numerically and qualitatively. Among these
strategies, the WGAN performs the best.
